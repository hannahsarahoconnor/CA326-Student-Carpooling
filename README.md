# CA326-Student-Carpooling ( 3rd year project )

Student Carpooling is an android app built and developed specifically for Irelandâ€™s university students. The app is available to any student who has an active and recognisable Irish university email address, along with an Android mobile device. It based on the typical idea of carpooling, but instead, works to connect student communities exclusively.
